# global infrastructure

## considerations

### legal compliance
sensitive data may be required to be stored in specific regions
- e.g. UK boundaries, etc...

### proximity
- user distance affects latency

### available services within a region
some services require hardware and can only be built one region at a time  
- e.g. braket, the quantum compute service

### pricing
each region has its own pricing


## Availability Zones
isolated zones within a region for availability redundancies
